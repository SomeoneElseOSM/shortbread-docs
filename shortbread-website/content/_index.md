# Shortbread Tiles

## About

The _Shortbread_ vector tile schema is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector
tile schema for [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

It does not, and cannot, cover the full breadth and depth of OpenStreetMap tagging.

This website contains the description of the [Shortbread tile schema](/schema/), and instrictions on how to [create Shortbread tiles](/make-vectortiles/).

Try it out with the [tile set of the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (403 MB)](/shortbread-examples/shortbread-baden-wuerttemberg.mbtiles).

## History

Shortbread was initially made (and is currently maintained) by [Geofabrik GmbH](https://www.geofabrik.de/), however it is intended to be a true community project and contributions are always welcome. Geofabrik has no intention of asserting any rights over Shortbread.
