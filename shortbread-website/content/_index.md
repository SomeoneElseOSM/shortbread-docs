# Shortbread â€“ a Simple Vector Tile Schema

The *Shortbread* vector tile schema is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector
tile schema for OpenStreetMap data.

It does not, and is not intended to, cover the full breadth and depth of OpenStreetMap tagging.

This repository contains the description of the tile schema, i.e. the available layers, their features and their
 attributes.

This schema documentation is published under the terms of the CC-0 license, generated using the Hugo framework, and the source is [on GitHub.](https://github.com/geofabrik/shortbread-docs)
