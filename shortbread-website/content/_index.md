# Shortbread â€“ a Simple Vector Tile Schema

The Geofabrik "Basic" vector tile schema is intended to be a basic, lean, general-purpose vector
tile schema for OpenStreetMap data.

It does not, and is not intended to, cover the full breadth and depth of OpenStreetMap tagging.

This repository contains the description of the tile schema, i.e. which layers there are on which
zoom levels and which attributes to expect on features in that layer.
