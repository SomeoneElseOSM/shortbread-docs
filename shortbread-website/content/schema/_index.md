This page describes the layers of the Shortbread vector schema and their contents.

## [Latest Shortbread Tiles schema (v1.0)](./1.0/)

## License & Copyright

Geofabrik takes the position that this schema is not creative enough to be a copyrightable
work. For the sake of clarity, however, we are releasing it under the CC-0 license.
For the avoidance of doubt, using this schema to create your vector tiles will not add any attribution
requirements, but if you generate vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data, you will of course have
to attribute OpenStreetMap.
